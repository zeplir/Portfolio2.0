        <h1>MY JOURNEY</h1>
        <p>My coding journey started in 2023, when I was studying sales and marketing, oddly enough. 
            One year in to the course I realized that sales was not quite for me. What I wanted to do was problem solving, 
            hence I got interested in programming.
        </p>
        <p>I then decided between JS or C as a starting language, 
            and decided that C would fit me better. So I dropped out of sales and started my journey at Chas academy C/C++.
            It was scary, but a nessecary leap of faith that I am so glad I took, since I have fallen in love 
            with programming.
        </p>
        <p>At first it was quite hard, however I pushed through and I am so happy I did, since I managed to land a job
            at Elsystem. The job at Elsystem is honestly amazing and I have learned so much not only about programming,
            but also about the industry in general. And I really look forward to learning a lot more.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time I like to go for walks with my two dogs Dibley and Oggi, work on coding projects and go to the gym.
            Since I spend more time behind a computer now because of school and my job, I have found the gym to be a 
            really nice place to be, it really helps me feel better and I believe it makes me a better programmer.

        <h2 id="title-1">Memory Game</h2>
        <p id="paragraph-1">This is a project where me and a few classmates made a memory game using an Arduino Uno. In this project I learned a lot about structure within C/C++ and classes and objects. It was also quite fun to learn about hardware as well, check it out <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JimmyWallener/Memory-Game">here</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="title-2">Home Security</h2>
        <p id="paragraph-2">In this project me and a classmate made a home alarm, in which we used an Arduino Uno and an ESP32. This product works as a break-in detector and uses sensors to detect movement and sound. Check it out <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JimmyWallener/home-security">here!</a></p>
